Steering meeting 

We discussed the Trello Board and then answered some questions about the Client and project etc.

We should write in effort hours instead of person hours.

Software Architecture:
    - For us it won't be very extensive. We should still describe the parts: database, client side, server etc. Show it in a simple picture etc.

Detailed design:
    - Database tables (good to bring), show how the fields look like. The strucuter and some sentences to descibe it. 

The design document should be able to describe all of the project as much as needed for a new person to quickly join and work in the group.

Use Case:

- Divide to how the user sees things.
- Calculate should be seen as 1 action.


Coupling and Cohesion should either be in architecture or in it's own section. We should also have some parts to show this.
