Steering group meeting 4

First we showed the steering group what we had done. Trello Board w47. We showed board w48.

We explained how far we had gone in implementation.

We were warned about overlap in the trello board activities. 

We should include all time, including all presentations and meetings in our times. All scheduled time etc.

Updated project plan: no strict deadline. -> no new feedback but our grade will depend on the new version.

Design description: it isn't a unfinished product, but we should write everything we know. Feel free to tell "we dont know yet" etc.

We showed the product (website) the steering group seemed pretty glad.

They liked our Trello and GIT. They liked the organization. They liked that we seem to use our stuff internally and that we do a lot of commits etc. 

We told about the purpose of the client meetings.

We told about the calculations and the steering board seem to want to see a full basic functionality soon.

They asked about task distribution and if everyone was contributing. We said everyone was doing at least okay results. They wanted us to report if it were something.
