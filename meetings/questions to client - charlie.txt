QUESTIONS TO THE CLIENT


MY IDEA OF THE EXCEL FILE:
*the input is just the fields inside the tabs "dina indata och resultat" and "grundläggande antaganden"?

*the results for the production cost and profitability are inside the red square in the tab "dina indata och resultat"?

*the results for the cash flow is inside the tab "kassaflöden", and then they are visualized in the diagrams in the tab "diagram"?
----------------


*save the used input values from one session to another - so just the fields inside the tabs "dina indata och resultat" and "grundläggande antaganden"?

*compare two results - so compare the production cost and profitability inside the "red square", and then the cash flow diagrams OR also the cash flow tables?

*diagrams - enough with the ones inside the "diagrams" tab?

*what should be in the report file? it says both INPUT and OUTPUT values? so both the input fields' values and the production cost/profitability/cash flow tables, diagrams?

*a separate info page with explanation of the formulas, dictionary of difficult words...?
