QUESTIONS TO THE CLIENT


MY IDEA OF THE EXCEL FILE:
*the input is just the fields inside the tabs "dina indata och resultat" and "grundläggande antaganden"?
[YES]

*the results for the production cost and profitability are inside the red square in the tab "dina indata och resultat"?
[YES, YOU CAN ALSO SEE THE CASH FLOW RESULTS INSIDE THE PROFITABILITY CELLS]

*the results for the cash flow is inside the tab "kassaflöden", and then they are visualized in the diagrams in the tab "diagram"?
[YES, YOU ALSO HAVE ANOTHER DIAGRAM CALLED "INTÄKTER" WHICH IS BASED ON THE CASH FLOW VALUES]

+1st table (with present values) start implementing this, if there's time continue with the table below (with IR function).
OBS. not discount rate in the table below, otherwise the calculations in the two tables are more or less the same. 

+diagrams, show them separately since it can be overwhelming for the user to watch all the information. one way to do this
is to give the user the possibility choose what result diagram to show, like using tabs/buttons...?
----------------


*save the used input values from one session to another - so just the green/yellow fields inside the tabs "dina indata och resultat" and "grundläggande antaganden"?
[YES CORRECT]

*compare two results - so compare the production cost and profitability inside the "red square", and then the cash flow diagrams OR also the cash flow tables?
[YES, you need to calculate the cash flow tables anyhow so these can be compared for more experienced users like companies.
otherwise comparing the cash flow could be done by comparing the diagrams or just the result values inside the profitability results (i.e. inside the "dina indata & resultat" tab)
for less experienced users like private persons.]

*when comparing two results, do you want it like in the "levelized cost of energy calculator (USA)" link? go to the "LCOE w/ Environmental costs" tab
[Leave it for later since it's an extra functionality, we can discuss it further with the client as soon as the basic functionalities are done.]

*diagrams - enough with the ones inside the "diagrams" tab?
[YES]

*what should be in the report file? it says both INPUT and OUTPUT values? so both the input fields' values and the production cost/profitability/cash flow tables, diagrams?
[input (from "dina indata & resultat" and "grundläggande antaganden") and output the production cost, profitability, cash flow - show the client later and let him decide to add/remove stuff.]

*a separate info page with explanation of the formulas, dictionary of difficult words...?
[YES, like a separate tab with information (find a good name for it)] 


EXTRA THINGS MENTIONED BY THE CLIENT:
+ picture in the header, bengt will look for some other suitable pictures.

+ name in swedish: sol ekonomi kalkylator, sol ekonomi miniräknaren, sol ekonomi räknaren.. (there are some suggestions in a file that the client sent)

+ "solceller" could be in the swedish product name 
+ ask people we know about a suitable name

+ version 2? future work, make a document for how the client can update the site, like how to enter stuff in the excel file to upload, how to import new images...

+ we will not implement the thing about regions in sweden affecting the amount of solar energy. [talked about it with the client]
