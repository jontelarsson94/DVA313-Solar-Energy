QUESTIONS FOR THE CLIENT
------------------------

1. Ask the client to go through the LCOE formula and its variables.

2. Ask the client to go through the excel sheets with all the different parameters and calculations (step by step).

3. The features from "it WOULD be nice if the user could...", which are most important to get done (rank them)?
   So that we can prioritize the ones that are most important. 

4. The client gives references to already existing websites and excel sheets, which of these does he like and why?
   (i.e. any particular features/functionalities?)
   
5. Talk about the layout and design suggestions. Agree on a design.

6. Which form of output is required? (like diagrams, file for printing, ...)

7. Convince the customers not to use an excel file for updating the values. Insteat, use of an admin account.
